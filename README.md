# Generator Front to Back

A fullstack template generator. Get reliable starter templates for your React.js, Node.js, React.js + Node.js, Django, or Django + React.js apps. Configure authentication types, databases and much more in a matter of seconds instead of having to go through the hassle of industry research and setting it up yourselves.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-front-to-back using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-front-to-back) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-front-to-back
```

Then generate your new project:

For React.js, Node.js or React.js + Node.js projects:-

```bash
yo front-to-back:javascript
```

For Django or Django + React.js projects:-

```bash
yo front-to-back:django
```

Answer a few simple questions and configure your app in a few seconds!

## Using Docker


Build the Docker images:

```bash
docker build -t generator-front-to-back:latest .
```

Make a folder where you want to generate the Service:

```bash
mkdir service
cd service
```

Run the generator from image to generate service:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/home/yo/app generator-front-to-back
```

Run and attach interactive shell to the generator docker container to work from inside the running container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/home/yo/app generator-front-to-back /bin/bash
```
